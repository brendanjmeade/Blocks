% MSH2COORDS extracts coordinate and vertex information from a Gmsh .msh file.
%
%   [C,V] = MSH2COORDS(FILE) extracts the coordinates and vertex ordering of 
%   triangular elements from the Gmsh .msh file named FILE.  The coordinates
%   are returned to the n x 3 array C, arranged with the x, y, and z locations
%   of coordinates in the three columns.  V is an m x 3 array containing the 
%   indices of the 3 vertices making up each of the m triangular elements.
